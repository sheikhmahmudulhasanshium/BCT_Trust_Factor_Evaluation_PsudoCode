# BCT-IATI Framework
<p align="justify"> The <b>BCT-IATI</b> (Blockchain Technology Industrial Adoption Trust Index) model is a tool that determines the level of trust of a particular blockchain-based product based on several trust factors. It was developed by <b>Sheikh Mahmudul Hasan Shium, Md. Mahabub Islam, S.A. Saharukh and Anamul Hoque Rafi</b> under the supervision of <b>Md. Mehedi Hassan Onik</b>. </p>

The trust in a product is calculated by considering some parameters. The parameters are called trust factors/ trust variables/ trust index. All trust factor belongs to either of the three categories-
<ol>
 <li>
 <b> Sub-factor/sub-category/independent parameter/independent variable/independent factor: </b> These parameters are independent and the score of these parameters are calculated separately. The independent parameters indirectly(via dependent parameter/external factor) influence the trust of blockchain. For example: Threat Severity, Threat Vulnerability, Response Efficacy, Self-efficacy, Experience, Job Relevance, Performance Verifiability, Image, Performance Expectancy and Effort Expectancy. 
 </li>
 <li>
<b> Main-factor/main-category/dependent parameter/dependent variable/dependent factor:</b> These parameters are dependent on the score of each parameter and the score is calculated by averaging the related independent parameters and external factors. The dependent parameters directly influence the overall trust in blockchain. For example: Threat Appraisal, Coping Appraisal, perceived usefulness, Behavioral Intention, Maladaptive Coping, Fear of Blockchain
 </li>
 <li>
<b> External factors/ External parameters/ External variables: </b>These parameters are  dependent or independent but have a strong influence on the intention to use BCT, or the main category of trust factors, which are the last types of trust factors. For example: System Complexity and Social Influence
 </li>
</ol>

# Relationship among trust parameters

The following rules justify the relationship among the parameters:
<ul> 
 <li>Performance Verifiability, Job Relevance, and Experience positively affect the Perceived usefulness.</li>
<li>Performance Expectancy positively and Effort Expectancy negatively influence Behavioral Intention.</li>
<li>Images affect both social influence and perceived usefulness positively.</li>
<li>Social influence affects Perceived Usefulness and behavioral intention positively.</li>
<li>Response efficacy and Self-efficacy influence Coping Appraisal positively.</li>
<li>Threat Severity and Threat Vulnerability affect Threat Appraisal positively.</li>
<li>Coping Appraisal affects Maladaptive Coping negatively.</li>
<li>Threat Appraisal influences Fear of Blockchain positively.</li>
<li>Perceived Usefulness positively, Behavioral Intention positively, Maladaptive Coping negatively, Fear of Blockchain negatively, and System Complexity negatively affect Intention to Use Blockchain.</li>
<li>Intention to use blockchain highly influences the trust level of blockchain positively.</li>
</ul>
