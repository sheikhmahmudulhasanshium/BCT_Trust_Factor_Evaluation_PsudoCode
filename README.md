# BCT-IATI Framework
<p align="justify"> The <b>BCT-IATI</b>(Blockchain Technology Industrial Adoption Trust Index) model is a tool that determines the level of trust of a particular blockchain-based product based on several trust factors. It was developed by <b>Sheikh Mahmudul Hasan Shium, Md. Mahabub Islam, S.A. Saharukh and Anamul Hoque Rafi</b> under the supervision of <b>Md. Mehedi Hassan Onik</b>. </p>

The trust in a product is calculated by considering some parameters. The parameters are called trust factors/ trust variables/ trust index. All trust factor belongs to either of the three categories-
<ol>
 <li>
 <b> Sub-factor/sub-category/independent parameter/independent variable/independent factor: </b> These parameters are independent and the score of these parameters are calculated separately. The independent parameters indirectly(via dependent parameter/external factor) influence the trust of blockchain. For example: Threat Severity, Threat Vulnerability, Response Efficacy, Self-efficacy, Experience, Job Relevance, Performance Verifiability, Image, Performance Expectancy and Effort Expectancy. 
 </li>
 <li>
<b> Main-factor/main-category/dependent parameter/dependent variable/dependent factor:</b> These parameters are dependent on the score of each parameter and the score is calculated by averaging the related independent parameters and external factors. The dependent parameters directly influence the overall trust in blockchain. For example: Threat Appraisal, Coping Appraisal, perceived usefulness, Behavioral Intention, Maladaptive Coping, Fear of Blockchain
 </li>
 <li>
<b> External factors/ External parameters/ External variables: </b>These parameters are  dependent or independent but have a strong influence on the intention to use BCT, or the main category of trust factors, which are the last types of trust factors. For example: System Complexity and Social Influence
 </li>
</ol>
